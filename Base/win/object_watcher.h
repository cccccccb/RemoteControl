		// A class that provides a means to asynchronously wait for a Windows object to become signaled.
		// It is an abstraction around RegisterWaitForSingleObject that provides a notification callback,
		// onObjectSignaled, that runs back on the origin sequence (i.e., the sequence that called
		// startWatching).
		//
		// This class acts like a smart pointer such that when it goes out-of-scope, UnregisterWaitEx is
		// automatically called, and any in-flight notification is suppressed.
		//
		// Typical usage:
		//
		//   class MyClass : public base::win::ObjectWatcher::Delegate
		//   {
		//   public:
		//       void doStuffWhenSignaled(HANDLE object)
		//       {
		//           watcher_.StartWatchingOnce(object, this);
		//       }
		//
		//       void onObjectSignaled(HANDLE object) override
		//       {
		//           // OK, time to do stuff!
		//       }
		//
		//   private:
		//       base::win::ObjectWatcher watcher_;
		//   };
		//
		// In the above example, MyClass wants to "do stuff" when object becomes signaled. ObjectWatcher
		// makes this task easy. When MyClass goes out of scope, the watcher_ will be destroyed, and there
		// is no need to worry about onObjectSignaled being called on a deleted MyClass pointer. Easy!
		// If the object is already signaled before being watched, OnObjectSignaled is still called after
		// (but not necessarily immediately after) watch is started.
		//

			bool startWatchingOnce(HANDLE object, Delegate* delegate);

			// Stops watching.  Does nothing if the watch has already completed.  If the watch is still
			// active, then it is canceled, and the associated delegate is not notified.
			// Returns true if the watch was canceled. Otherwise, false is returned.
